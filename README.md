# neoteric: An open-source Automotive Control System for Classic Cars

neoteric is both a product and a project.  The idea is to add technology to older cars, race cars, or really anything that doesn't have electronics on-board.  Stay tuned as we build up our first controller sub-system: a temperature-controlled relay

## Build Tutorials

The entire process of design and build of neoteric is [availble on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhCiXHwyBtSG45CGrDBlqeXXfJQwoWFP4).

## Microcontroller

neoteric is desinged around the [Wilderness Labs Meadow](https://www.wildernesslabs.co) platform.

## Sensors

The following sensors are in development or planned:

Coolant Temperature
Fan Control Relay
System Voltage
Fuel Level
Oil Pressure
Air Temperature
Intake Manifold Air Pressure (MAP)

## PCBs

We will be developing and open-sourcing PCBs for all of our work

## Code

We will be developing and open-sourcing code fo all of our work

## CAD

We will try to find standard, inexpensive, appropriate enclosures When not feasible, we will be developing and open-sourcing things like enclosures, brackets and whatnot and publishing STLs to allow 3D printing or CNC machining of the parts.

Stay tuned, and if you'd like to help out, let us know.
